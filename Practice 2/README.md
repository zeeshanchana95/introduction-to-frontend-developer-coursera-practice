<b>Simple HTML tags:</b><br>
There are many tags available in HTML. Here you will learn about common tags that you'll use as a developer.<br><br>

<b>Headings</b><br>
Headings allow you to display titles and subtitles on your webpage.<br><br>

<b>Paragraphs</b><br>
Paragraphs contain text content.<br><br>

<b>Note</b> that putting content on a new line is ignored by the web browser.<br><br>

<b>Line Breaks</b><br>
As you've learned, line breaks in the paragraph tag line are ignored by HTML. Instead, they must be specified using the "br" tag. The "br" tag does not need a closing tag.<br><br>

<b>Strong</b><br>
Strong tags can be used to indicate that a range of text has importance.<br><br>

<b>Bold</b><br>
Bold tags can be used to draw the reader's attention to a range of text.<br><br>

Bold tags should be used to draw attention but not to indicate that something is more important. Consider the following example:<br><br>

<b>Emphasis</b><br>
Emphasis tags can be used to add emphasis to text.<br><br>

<b>Italics</b><br>
Italics tags can be used to offset a range of text.<br><br>

<b>Emphasis vs. Italics</b><br>
By default both tags will have the same visual effect in the web browser. The only difference is the meaning.<br>
Emphasis tags stress the text contained in them.<br>
Screen readers will not announce any difference if an italics tag is used.<br><br>

<b>Lists</b><br>
You can add lists to your web pages. There are two types of lists in HTML.<br>
Lists can be unordered using the ul tag. List items are specified using the li tag,<br><br>

Lists can also be ordered using the ol tag. Again, list items are specified using the ol tag.<br><br>

<b>Div tags</b><br>
A div tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS.<br><br>

It can be nested inside other elements.<br><br>

As mentioned, the div has no impact on content unless it is styled by CSS. Letâ€™s add a small CSS rule that styles all divs on the page.<br><br>

Don't worry about the meaning of the CSS just yet, you'll explore CSS further in a later lesson. In summary, you're applying a rule that adds a border and some visual spacing to the element.<br><br>


<b>Comments</b><br>
If you want to leave a comment in the code for other developers, 

The comment will not be displayed in the web browser.
